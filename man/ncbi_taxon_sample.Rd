\arguments{
\item{name}{(\code{character} of length 1) The taxon to download a sample of
sequences for.}

\item{id}{(\code{character} of length 1) The taxon id to download a sample of
sequences for.}

\item{target_rank}{(\code{character} of length 1) The finest taxonomic rank
at which to sample. The finest rank at which replication occurs. Must be a
finer rank than \code{taxon}.}

\item{min_counts}{(named \code{numeric}) The minimum number of sequences to
download for each taxonomic rank. The names correspond to taxonomic ranks.}

\item{max_counts}{(named \code{numeric}) The maximum number of sequences to
download for each taxonomic rank. The names correspond to taxonomic ranks.}

\item{interpolate_min}{(\code{logical}) If \code{TRUE}, values supplied to
\code{min_counts} and \code{min_children} will be used to infer the values
of intermediate ranks not specified. Linear interpolation between values of
specified ranks will be used to determine values of unspecified ranks.}

\item{interpolate_max}{(\code{logical}) If \code{TRUE}, values supplied to
\code{max_counts} and \code{max_children} will be used to infer the values
of intermediate ranks not specified. Linear interpolation between values of
specified ranks will be used to determine values of unspecified ranks.}

\item{min_children}{(named \code{numeric}) The minimum number sub-taxa of
taxa for a given rank must have for its sequences to be searched. The names
correspond to taxonomic ranks.}

\item{max_children}{(named \code{numeric}) The maximum number sub-taxa of
taxa for a given rank must have for its sequences to be searched. The names
correspond to taxonomic ranks.}

\item{seqrange}{(character) Sequence range, as e.g., "1:1000". This is the
range of sequence lengths to search for. So "1:1000" means search for
sequences from 1 to 1000 characters in length.}

\item{getrelated}{(logical) If TRUE, gets the longest sequences of a species
in the same genus as the one searched for. If FALSE, returns nothing if no
match found.}

\item{fuzzy}{(logical) Whether to do fuzzy taxonomic ID search or exact
search. If \code{TRUE}, we use \code{xXarbitraryXx[porgn:__txid<ID>]}, but
if \code{FALSE}, we use \code{txid<ID>}. Default: \code{FALSE}}

\item{limit}{(\code{numeric}) Number of sequences to search for and return.
Max of 10,000. If you search for 6000 records, and only 5000 are found, you
will of course only get 5000 back.}

\item{entrez_query}{(\code{character}; length 1) An Entrez-format query to
filter results with. This is useful to search for sequences with specific
characteristics. The format is the same as the one used to seach genbank.
(\url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3837/#EntrezHelp.Entrez_Searching_Options})}

\item{hypothetical}{(\code{logical}; length 1) If \code{FALSE}, an attempt
will be made to not return hypothetical or predicted sequences judging from
accession number prefixs (XM and XR). This can result in less than the
\code{limit} being returned even if there are more sequences available,
since this filtering is done after searching NCBI.}

\item{verbose}{(\code{logical}) If \code{TRUE}, progress messages will be
printed.}

\description{
Downloads a sample of sequences meant to evenly capture the diversity of a
given taxon. Can be used to get a shallow sampling of vast groups.
\strong{CAUTION:} This function can make MANY queries to Genbank depending on
arguments given and can take a very long time. Choose your arguments
carefully to avoid long waits and needlessly stressing NCBI's servers. Use a
downloaded database and a parser from the \code{taxa} package when possible.
