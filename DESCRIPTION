Description: Reads, plots, and manipulates large
    taxonomic data sets, like those generated from modern high-throughput
    sequencing, such as metabarcoding (i.e. amplification metagenomics, 16S
    metagenomics, etc). It provides a tree-based visualization called "heat
    trees" used to depict statistics for every taxon in a taxonomy using
    color and size. It also provides various functions to do common tasks in
    microbiome bioinformatics on data in the 'taxmap' format defined by the
    'taxa' package. The 'metacoder' package is described in the publication
    by Foster et al. (2017) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005404>.
